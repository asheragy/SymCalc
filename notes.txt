Maybe important features
- Cannot define variable with same name as function (case insensitive)
- UserFunction requires name, does it need to?  How do these really work?  Is it just an expression?  May not be implemented correctly here / Function[]
- NumberExpr should maybe not do conversions between types of different precision, Int+Rational is fine but Int+Double should be converted before ever getting there

Non-Important Features
- Integer to string, full number spelled out
- Help info ?functionName

- Kotlin yield operator, possibly represent infinite lists and do operations on them
